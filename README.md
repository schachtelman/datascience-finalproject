# Data Science - Final Project
The final project for the Data Science course.

The general topic is to find out something interesting about the alcohol consumption of humans. We will fix a more specific topic and hypothesis once we have an overview of available datasets.

## Ideas

## Gin Score Predictor (Genie)

It would be nice to predict how well a certain mixture of gin-tonic (or drink in general) is received by a thirsty customer. This score could for example be used to build a basic recommender system as well. We could build a basic system were the user can select ingredients for his/her drink and his/her age, etc. and then predict how likely it is that the user likes the drink. 

### Datasets

[Statista](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/171629/umfrage/mindestens-einmal-im-monat-konsumierte-spirituosen/) seems to have quite a large selection of surveys on how people like to consume their alcohol (favorite brands, favorite drink, amount of cosumtion, etc.). From this we could infer some simple score based on the brands and drinks used in the mixture.

Maybe we also find some demographic data on alcohol consumption and attitudes towards certain drinks. Then we could include a score based on the age, gender, education status of the user as well.
